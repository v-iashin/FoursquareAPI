# FoursquareAPI
The very first need for creating this repo was to share a reproducible code of parsing the data for our project submitted to The Young Scientist Symposium on Applied Data Analysis (2017) (https://spb.hse.ru/bigweek/studresearch/data_analysis). The reproducible code is contained in 'HSE'-folder.

This repo was also created in order to provide--since the lack of any--with a simple example of setting up Foursquare API on Python using 'foursquare' wrapper (https://github.com/mLewisLogic/foursquare). An interested one will get the *venues* data (tips, userId, and other info) given geolocation and the data about a *user* (homecity, gender, a number of friends, lists, checkins, photos, and tips) given a list of user IDs using the provided code. The set of chosen variables might be easily adopted for one's needs (see also https://developer.foursquare.com/docs). The 'Examples'-folder contains these two examples showing how to get the data that was mentioned above.
